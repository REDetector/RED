<h1>Intensity Replicate Filter</h1>

<p>
    The intensity difference filter is a variation on the intensity difference filter which
    can be used to analyse two or more replicate sets. It uses the same principal as the
    intensity difference filter where it constructs a comparable set of points from probes
    with similar average intensity over two replicate sets, but it then uses the replicate
    information within each of the sets to construct a statistical test to judge whether
    the degree of conservation between replicates for each probe is high enough to call it
    as differentially expressed.
</p>

<p>
    The intensity replicate filter can only be applied to replicated data which has been
    put into replicate sets. It is a more conservative test than the standard replicate
    set stats test, but is less conservative than the intensity difference test.

<h2>Options</h2>
<ul>
    <li>You can set the p-value threshold below which probes will be kept. P-values in this
        filter are always corrected for multiple testing using a Benjamini and Hochberg correction.
    </li>
</ul>
