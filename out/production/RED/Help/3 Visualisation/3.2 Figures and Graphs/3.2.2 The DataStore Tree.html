<h1>The DataStore Tree</h1>

<p>The DataStore tree view is a very quick way of being able to see the degree
    of relatedness of several DataStores</p>

<p><img src="datastore_tree.png" alt="The DataStore Tree"></p>

<p>
    This view uses a Pearson correlation to calculate a distance matrix between
    all of the currently visible data stores. It then constructs a neighbour
    joining tree from the matrix.
</p>

<p>
    You need to have at least 3 visible quantitated DataStores to draw a tree. To begin
    drawing your tree select Plots &gt; DataStore Tree from the main menu.
