<h1>Filtering</h1>
<p>
Once you have quantitated your data SeqMonk offers a variety of
different types of filter to reduce your initial set of probes
down to a small subset of regions of interest.
</p>
<p>
All filters operate on the currently active probe list (the one
you have selected in the Data View), and they will produce a 
subset of the current active list.
<p>
<p>
It is worth spending some time looking through the different
filters available.  You should also remember that it can be very
useful to requantitate your data to allow you to filter against
another property of your data, and that this will not affect your
current probe lists as long as you only change the quantiation and
do not rerun the probe generation step.
