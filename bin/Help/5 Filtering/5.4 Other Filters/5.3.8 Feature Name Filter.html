<h1>Feature Name Filter</h1>
<p>
The feature name filter allows you to select a set of probes based on a 
match between their names and the names of a set of features in an 
annotation track.

<p>
This type of filter is useful where you have imported an annotation track
containing a subset of features and you want to select the same subset in the 
current project.  For example you might have a list of transcripts whose promoters
are enriched in a certain histone modification, and you want to see what these
same transcripts do in an RNA-Seq dataset.  The positions of the probes from
the histone modification dataset will not match the transcript positions in the
RNA-Seq dataset (one is promoters the other is transcripts), but the names will
be the same between the two, so this filter can be used.
</p>

<h2>Options</h2>
<ol>
<li>You can choose the annotation track containing the set of features whose names
you want to match.</li>
<li>You can choose to remove additions which SeqMonk would have placed on the end
of feature names when using them to create probes (eg _upstream, _downstream or _gene).
</ol>
