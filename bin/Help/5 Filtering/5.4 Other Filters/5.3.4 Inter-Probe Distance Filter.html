<h1>Inter-Probe Distance Filter</h1>

<p>
    This filter allows you to select probes based on the distance to
    another probe. You could use it to identify clusters of probes, or
    isolated probes. You could also use it to select groups of probes
    with a specific periodicity.
</p>

<p>
    Distance measurements are taken from the end of one probe to the start
    of the other.
</p>

<h2>Options</h2>
<ol>
    <li>The minimum and maximum distance between probes (only one needs to be specified)</li>
    <li>Whether the distance spanned can pass over another probe</li>
</ol>
