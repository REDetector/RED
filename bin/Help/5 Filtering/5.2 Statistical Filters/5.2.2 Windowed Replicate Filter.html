<h1>Windowed Replicate Filter</h1>
<p>
The windowed replicate filter can be used to look for a consistent effect
across a set of adjacent probes.  It uses either a t-test or an Anova to
assess whether a set of probes shows a signficant difference either between
two or more data stores, or from a distribution with a mean of zero.

<h2>Options</h2>
<ul>
<li>You need to select one or more DataStores from the list on the left.  Data
Sets are shown in red and Data Stores are shown in Blue.  If you select a single
store you will be comparing to a mean of 0.  Selecting two stores performs a
t-test between the two sets of data and selecting more than two performs an Anova.</li>
<li>You need to select a p-value cutoff.  Probe from within windows where the
p-value is below the cutoff will be included in the filtered set.</li>
<li>You can select how to construct the windows inside which the test will
be performed.  This can be expressed either as a fixed number
of bases, or as a number of consecutive probes to slide over the genome. You can also choose to use a class of
features as the windows in which to aggregate probes.  For a test to be performed you must
have at least 3 probes falling inside the window you have chosen</li>
<li>The multiple testing correction option will adjust your p-value using a Benjamini
and Hochberg correction to take account of the number of tests you have performed.  Raw
p-values are only valid for a single test, and if you perform multiple tests you must
correct your p-values to get an accurate representation of the significance of your results.</li>
</ul>
