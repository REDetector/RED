<h1>Opening an Existing Project</h1>
<p>
To open an existing project select File &gt; Open Project from the main menu.  All
SeqMonk project files use a .smk file extension.  The file menu also contains a list
of the five most recently opened projects which you can use to quickly re-open them.
</p>
<p>
A SeqMonk project stores all of the Data Set, Data Group, Probe Set and Probe List 
information for your project.  It also remembers which annotation and data tracks
were visible. 
</p>
<p>
Although it stores the name of the genome you were using it doesn't
contain the actual genome data.  If you are using SeqMonk on a new machine it will
therefore automatically download and install the required genome when you open a
project file.  If you want to use SeqMonk when not connected to a network you
therefore need to ensure that the correct genome has been installed on your machine
before disconnecting it from the internet.  Once downloaded, genomes will be cached
on your machine for future use.
</p>

<p>
When opening a project SeqMonk checks to see if the project file is compatible with
the version of SeqMonk you are using.  If you try to open a project file from a newer
version of SeqMonk on an older SeqMonk version you may get an error telling you you
need to upgrade to the newest version of SeqMonk.  Newer versions of SeqMonk can
always open project files from older versions of the program.
