<h1>Importing Probes as Data</h1>
<p>
In some cases you might want to convert a set of probe positions into a data
track so that you can do some additional quantitation on them.  You can do
this using the Active Probe List Parser.  This takes whichever is the currently
selected Probe List and turns the positions and strands of these probes into
a data track.

<h2>Options</h2>

<p>
The options you have when re-importing are the same as you'd see when
importing data from a traditional single end data source (BAM file etc).
