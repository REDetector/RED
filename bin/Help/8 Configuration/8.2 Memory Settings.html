<h1>Memory Settings</h1>
<p>
SeqMonk works with very large data sets (both genome annotations and
mapping data), and it therefore requires a large amount of RAM to run.
</p>
<p>
Whilst most aspects of the program can be altered from within SeqMonk
itself, the total amount of memory available to the program is determined
when it is started.  The SeqMonk launcher program will try to determine the
optimal amount of memory to assign to SeqMonk when it starts, but you 
may need to take steps to adjust this in some cases.
</p>

<h2>General Limitations</h2>
<p>
The default configuration of SeqMonk is to assign the program 2/3 of the
physical memory installed on your machine.  Thus on a machine with 6GB of
RAM, 4GB will be allocated to SeqMonk. Because of overheads in java itself
the amount of available memory reported in the welcome screen will be around
80% of the originally allocated memory.
</p>
<p>
This default allocation is then limited in some cases.  If you are running
a 32 bit operating system, or a 64 bit operating system but a 32 bit version
of java then the maximum memory allocation is limited to 1.5GB however much
RAM is installed.  If you want to make use of more memory than this you will
need a 64 bit OS and version of java.  On 64 bit machines running 64 bit 
java the top memory limit for SeqMonk is 8GB, and it's unlikely that you'll
benefit from using more than that.
</p>

<p>
If you do want to manually set the SeqMonk memory allocation you can do this.
</p>

<h2>Windows and Linux</h2>
<p>
Changing the memory allocation in windows or linux is as simple as passing
an extra parameter when launching the program.  Instead of starting seqmonk
by just running 'seqmonk' you would run 'seqmonk -m XXXX' where XXXX is the
amount of memory (in MB) you want to use.
</p>
<h2>OSX</h2>
<p>
SeqMonk on OSX is distributed as an application bundle, inside which
is the configuration file which determines the amount of available memory.
To change this do the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the SeqMonk application in the Finder.</li>

<li>Control-click on the application and select "Show package Contents"</li>

<li>Double click on the contents folder</li>

<li>Double click the Info.plist file (this will open an application called
Property List Editor.</li>

<li>Look for the line which says 'executable file'</li>

<li>Edit the value from 'seqmonk' to 'seqmonk -m XXXXX' where XXXXX is the 
amount of memory (in MB) you want to use.</li>

<li>Once you've finished, select File > Save to
save your changes and then quit PropertyListEditor.</li>

<li>Restart SeqMonk and the new memory limits will be used.</li>
</ol>
