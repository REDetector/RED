<h1>Saving a Project</h1>
<p>
You can choose to save a project at any point. A SeqMonk project
file is a single file which saves both your data and many of
your display preferences so that you can get back to working on
your data very quickly.
</p>
<p>
Data which is stored in a project file is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The positions of all of your reads</li>
<li>The details of your samples</li>
<li>The details of your sample groups</li>
<li>The positions of your probes</li>
<li>The quantitated value for all probes for all DataStores</li>
<li>All current probe lists</li>
<li>The list of currently visible data and annotation tracks</li>
<li>The current position of the chromosome view</li>
<li>The current data zoom level</li>
<li>The current data view (probes+reads, just probes, just reads)</li>
<li>The current data scale (positive or positive and negative</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some preferences are not stored in the project file and won't be
remembered when the program reopens.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The genome annotation data (this is referenced and will be downloaded from the SeqMonk server if required)</li>
<li>The size and layout of the panels in the current display (in case you open the file on a different sized screen)</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you have changed any of the details which SeqMonk stores in its
project file during your session, when you close the program you will
be prompted to re-save the project before exiting.

You should be aware that because SeqMonk has to write out all of the read
data when it saves a project that this can take a few minutes to complete
if you have several large datasets open.
