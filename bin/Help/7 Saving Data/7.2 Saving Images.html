<h1>Saving Images</h1>
<p>
You can export any of the images you see in SeqMonk into two different
graphics formats.  Most dialogs which open to show you an image will
have a save button at the bottom.  To export the graphics you see in
the main SeqMonk window you can select File &gt; Export Current View 
from the main menu and then choose from the Genome View and the
Chromosome View.
</p>
<p>
You can choose from two different formats for your exported images.  You
can select which of these you want by using the drop down selector box
in the file selection dialog.

<h3>PNG Images</h3>
<p>
PNG images are the default selection.  These are bitmap images, which means
that you can only edit them in the same way that you would edit a photograph.
You can't make these images any larger and they will be produced initially
at the same size as you saw them on screen.  They are the equivalent of taking
a screenshot.  These images can be opened in almost any program which can
handle images, but are probably not of sufficient quality to use for publications.
</p>
<h3>SVG Images</h3>
<p>
SVG images are vector images which means that you can blow them up to any size
and they will still look smooth.  You can also break them apart and edit the 
individual components.  SVG images can only be viewed and edited by a more limited
range of software but these packages can render high-quality bitmap images from
the SVG images and these can then be used in publications.  We would recommend the
free program Inkscape (www.inkscape.org) for editing SVG files, or you could use
a commercial package such as Adobe Illustrator.
