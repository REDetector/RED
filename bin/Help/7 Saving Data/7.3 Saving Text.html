<h1>Saving Text</h1>
<p>
When you generate a report or a probe list you can choose to save this.
All text based exports in SeqMonk are written out as tab-delimited
text files.  Although you can open these in any text editor you can
also open them directly in a spreadsheet application which should
recognise them and import them whilst keeping the structure of the
original table.
