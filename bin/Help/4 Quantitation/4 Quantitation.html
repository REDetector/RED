<h1>Quantitation</h1>

<p>
If you want to use any of the analysis tools in SeqMonk rather than 
just viewing the raw data then you will need to perform a quantitation.
</p>
<p>
There are two step to quantitating data, the first of which you'd normally
only perform once, but the second of which could be performed several times
within a single analysis session.  In addition there are some pre-built
pipelines which automate these steps allowing all of the quantitation to be
done in a single step.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Define a set of probes: Use one of the available probe generators to
define a set of genomic regions in which you are going to quantitate your
data.</li>
<li>Quantitate your data within each of these regions to assign a numeric
value to each probe for each DataStore</li>
</ol>
<p>
This quantitation system has been designed to be as flexible as possible and
as such there are multiple ways to define probes and multiple ways to use
your data to associate a value with each of those probes.
</p>
<p>
If you can think of a new way to define probes or a new way to quantitate
your data please contact us and we'll look at adding it in as a new
quantitation option.
</p>

<h2>Defining Probes</h2>
<p>
To being defining probes select Data &gt; Define Probes.
</p>
<p><img src="define_probes.png" alt="Define Probes"></p>
<p>
Down the left hand side are the currently available list of probe generators.
If you select an item in this list you will see the options for that 
generator appear in the area on the right.  Once you are happy with the options
you have set you can press the &quot;Create Probes&quot; button to begin
generating your probes.
</p>
<p>
You should be aware that generating a set of probes will automatically remove
any probes you currently have defined and all current probe lists.  It is normal
therefore to define your probe set only once during an analysis, or to keep 
separate project files for the same data with different sets of probes defined.
</p>
<p>
Once you have defined your probes you will need to move straight on to
quantitating them as they won't show up in the display until a quantitation has
associated a value with each probe.
</p>

<h2>Quantitating</h2>
<p>
As with probe generation there are a variety of ways to quantiate your
data.  To start quantitation you should select Data &gt; Quantitate Existing Probes.
</p>
<p><img src="quantitation_options.png" alt="Quantitation Options"></p>
<p>
The list on the left are the different available modules for quantitating
your data.  If you select an item in the list then the options for that
module will appear in the area on the right.  Once you have set the 
appropriate options you can press the &quot;Quantitate&quot; button at the
bottom to start the quantitation process.
</p>
<p>
Some quantitation methods do not operate on the raw data, but instead modify
the existing quantitation values you already have.  In the list of quantitation
options methods which require an existing quantitation are shown in red, and
those which don't are shown in blue.  If you do not have an existing quantitation
then only the blue options will be shown.
</p>
<p>
Some quantitation methods are designed to work on HiC paired reads rather than
normal mapped data.  These methods are shown in green and will not appear if
your project doesn't currently contain any HiC data stores.
</p>
<p>
When you quantitate your data you will not change the list of probes you have
defined and your existing probe lists will remain intact.  It is therefore
common to perform a quantitation - perform some filtering - perform a different
quantiation - perform some more filtering, in order to generate a final set
of regions of interest.
</p>
<p>
Since different quantitation methods produce drastically different quantitated
data ranges your data zoom level will be automatically adjusted after each
quantitation to something appropriate to the new quantitation range.
</p>
<h2>Other options</h2>
<p>
If you have a large number of data stores defined in your project then you may
wish to only analyse a subset of these.  To speed up this type of analysis you
can choose to apply the quantitation you have selected only to the data stores
which are currently visble in the chromosome view.  To do this simply tick the
box which says &quot;Only quantitate visible stores&quot;
</p>
<h2>Pipelines</h2>
<p>
In addition to quantitating your data using the normal two step approach there
is also the option to use a pre-built quantitation pipeline.  Pipelines can
perform the probe generation and quantitation steps in a single operation and
also have the ability to run a default set of filters.  In some cases they are
simply ways to automate tasks which you could have performed with the standard
quantitation tools, but they are also able to do things normal quantitation cannot.
For example the RNA-Seq pipeline generates probes over entire transcripts, but
performs a quantitation only on reads falling inside exons within that transcript.
