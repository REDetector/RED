<h1>The Bisulphite feature methylation pipeline</h1>

<p>
The bisulphite feature methylation pipeline is a way to quantitate 
methylation over a whole feature but using only individual bases
whose methylation state is well observed.  It allows you to select
a class of features in which it calculates the percentage methylation
using positions with a minimum level of observation.
</p>
<p>
The pipeline assumes that you have methlyation data which uses the
standard convention of assigning methylated reads to the forward
strand and unmethylated reads to the reverse strand.  The reads should
generally only be 1bp in length.  This is the standard data you would
get from importing a bismark file directly, or importing the output
of the bismark methylation extractor via the text import option.
</p>


<h2>Options</h2>
<p>The options you can set for this pipeline are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which type of feature you want to quantitate</li>

<li>The mimumum level of observation required to include a base in
the methylation calculation.  This is simply the depth of count over
that base.</li>

<li>The minimum level of observation for a feature - ie how many
individual bases need to have been called to make a call for the
feature as a whole.</li>

<li>How to combine the measures for a given feature.  You can choose
to report the mean, median, max or min value from the set of individual
base measures.</li>

<li>What value to assign to features whose methylation could not be
calculated</li>

</ol>
