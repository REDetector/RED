<h1>Read Position probe generator</h1>

<p>
The read position is a somewhat specialised probe generator which
is designed to be used for datasets where you have reads occurring
at a small defined number of positions.  It places a probe at
every distinct read position in the dataset.  Applications which
could use this generator would be tag counting applications (such
as 4C experiments), or the analysis of introns to find changes in
splicing usage.
</p>
<h2>Warning</h2>
<p>
This probe generator is NOT suitable for any type of diverse dataset.
Trying to use this generator on a diverse dataset will result in the
generation of millions of probes which is likely to cause your
machine to grind to a halt.

<h2>Options</h2>
<ul>
<li>The data stores which whose data will be used to define the probes</li>
<li>The minimum number of read position occurrences required to generate
a probe</li>
<li>Whether to merge read positions which are the same except for their
strand</li>
</ul>
