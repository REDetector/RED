<h1>Create Probes from Existing List</h1>

<p>
This generator allows you to choose a Probe List from your currently
quantitated data and requantitate your data such that only the probes
within this list will be used for further work.
</p>
<p>
This filter could be useful if you initially generated a larger number of
probes using a running window generator, but then immediately filtered these
to keep only those containing good quality data.  Rather than having to work
with the very large list you could now use this filter to remake your probe
set using only the probes from the filtered list.  This will make SeqMonk
quicker to work with and use less memory for all future operations.
</p>
<p>
The only option is a drop down box from which you can select which of your
current probe lists you want to use to create your new probe set.
