<h1>Percent Coverage Quantitation</h1>

<p>
The percent coverage quantitation tells you how much of each probe
is covered by a read.  It doesn't matter what the coverage depth
is over the parts which are covered just how much consensus sequence
could be gathered.
</p>
<p>
This kind of quantation might be useful for datasets with a high level
of coverage where you are looking for regions which either couldn't
be mapped to uniquely, or which may have been deleted and therefore
are not represented in any data.
