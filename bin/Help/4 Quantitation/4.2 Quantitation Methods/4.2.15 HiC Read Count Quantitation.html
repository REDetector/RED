<h1>HiC Read Count Quantitation</h1>

<p>
The HiC Read Count quantitation is a simple way to look at the HiC
coverage in a set of probes.  It works very much like the normal
read count quantitation, except that it counts at the level of HiC
read pairs.  Any HiC read pair with one end overlapping the current
probe will be counted in the quantitation, but pairs where both ends
fall into the same probe will only be counted once.

<h2>Options</h2>
<p><img src="hic_read_count_quantitation.png" alt="HiC Read Count Quantitation Picture"></p>
<p>The options you have for this module are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whether you want to correct for the total read count.  If you are comparing
different datasets with different total counts then this will normalise the average
count per probe.
<li>Whether you want to correct for the length of your probes.  If your probes are
of different sizes you would expect to get a higher count in longer probes.  This
correction adjusts the count to a count per kilobase of probe, so a 1kb probe would
get raw counts and other sizes would be adjusted.  Unless your average probe length
is much longer than your average read length this correction could introduce a bias
into your results since the correction is just off probe length, but the counts
include any read which overlaps your probe - even if only by a single base.
</li>
<li>If you want to log transform your count.  If you have a large range of values
in your count you can calculate them on a log2 scale to make them easier to view.</li>
<li>If you want to ignore duplicated reads.  If you select this option then every
unique read position (start, end and strand must be the same) will only be counted
once and duplicates will be ignored</li>
</ol>
<h2>Warning</h2>
<p>
If you choose to quantitate your data on a log scale then any probes which contain
no reads will have their initial read count increased to 0.9 reads to avoid problems
with infinite values when log transforming. This value is set before any subsequent
correction for total read count or probe size.  This means that in log transformed
data different data stores could end up with different absolute values for probes
containing no reads.  If probe length correction is applied then probes with no
reads will end up with a range of low values reflecting the different lengths of the
probes. In these cases you might want to use an initial linear quantitation to allow you
to flag and possibly filter out the regions with no reads, before later moving on to
quantitate on a log scale.
