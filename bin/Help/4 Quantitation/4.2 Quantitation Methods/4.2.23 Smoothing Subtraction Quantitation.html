<h1>Smoothing Subtraction Quantitation</h1>

<p>
The smoothing subtration quantitation allows you to average the values of an 
existing quantitation in windows which are defined either by the
number of bases in the window, or as a number of adjacent probes 
and then subtract this smoothed value from the existing quantitation.
</p>
<p>
It is useful where you want to look at the local fluctuation of a quantitated
value whilst removing the effect of larger scale fluctuations which may be
happening on globally and which would otherwise influence any calls you made
based on absolute values in the original quantitation.
