<h1>Manual Correction Quantitation</h1>

<p>
    In some cases it will make sense to adjust your quantitation by
    a factor which can't be calculated from within SeqMonk. You may
    have other experimental data from outside the sequencing experiment
    which you want to use to correct your quantitated values.
</p>

<p>
    The manual correction quantitation allows you to adjust some or all
    of your quantiations by supplying a user-defined correction factor
    for your data.
</p>

<h2>Options</h2>
<ul>
    <li>What type of correction to apply (add, subtract, multiply, divide)</li>
    <li>A correction factor for each currently quantitated data store. Any stores
        where a factor is not supplied will be left with their original quantitation
        values
    </li>
</ul>
