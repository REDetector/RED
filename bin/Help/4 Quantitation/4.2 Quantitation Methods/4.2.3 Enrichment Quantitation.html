<h1>Enrichment Quantitation</h1>

<p>
The Enrichment quantitation is a simple method for quantitating your data
based on a the degree of enrichment you see in a given region relative to
what you would have expected if the data in your sample had been evenly
distributed over your whole genome.
</p>
<p>
The value produced is a log2 ratio of the observed base density in the region
divided by the overall base density for the sample. Positive values indicate
that a region is enriched relative to a random sample - negative values
indicate that it is depleted.  eg A value of 2 would indicate a 4-fold enrichment
over random.

<h2>Options</h2>

There are no options for the enrichment quantiation.
