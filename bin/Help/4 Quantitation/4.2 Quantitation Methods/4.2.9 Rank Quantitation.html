<h1>Rank Quantitation</h1>

<p>
The Rank quantitaion requires that you have quantitated your
data already using one of the other quanitation methods.  It
is a way of providing a distribution free method of looking
at your data.
</p>
<p>
The rank quantitation finds all of the unique quantitated values
in each data store and ranks them from lowest to highest.  It
then replaces the original quantitation value with how far
through the ranked set (0-100%) that ranked value came.  Duplicated
values will receive the same ranked value.
