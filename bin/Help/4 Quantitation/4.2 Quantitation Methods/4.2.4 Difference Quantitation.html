<h1>Difference Quantitation</h1>

<p>
The difference quantitation quantitates your data based on the relative
levels of reads on different strands.  
</p>
<p>
It can be useful to use the
strand of a read to signify some other property of your sequence (eg
methylated / unmethylated or exact match vs SNP). This quantitation
method then allows you to look for enrichment of this kind of information
in a way which accounts for overall biases in the distribution of sequences.
</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<p><img src="difference_quantitationpic.png" alt="Difference Quantitation Picture"></p>
<p>The options you have for this module are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The strands you want to compare (Forward / Reverse / Unknown).</li>
<li>How you want to do the comparison (subtract, divide or log divide).  If you 
want to get a simple corrected value you'd probably just subtract one count
from another.  If you're looking for an enrichment then using a ratio is better.  If
your enrichment could be either positive or negative you should take a log
ratio so that the positive and negative scales are treated the same</li>
</ol>

<p>
For the divide, and log divide options the quantitation will actually add 1 to
both of the counts used to avoid getting a divide-by-zero error, so the value
you see may be slightly off from what you expect - especially for probes with
low absolute counts (from which you probably shouldn't be calcuating this sort
of value anyway).
