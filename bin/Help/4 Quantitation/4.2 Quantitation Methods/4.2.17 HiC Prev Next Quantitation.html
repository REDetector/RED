<h1>HiC Prev Next Quantitation</h1>

<p>
The prev next quantitation is an implementation of the Directionality
index proposed by Dixon et al. (Nature doi:10.1038/nature11082).  It
provides a way to look for correlated domains within a HiC dataset.
Domain boundaries are represented by sudden changes in the DI measure.
</p>
<p>
The measure itself looks at the relative strength of HiC interactions
in windows upstream and downstream of each probe and produces a value
which quantitates this.

<h2>Options</h2>
<p>The options you have for this module are:</p>
<ol>
<li>What size window you want to use to capture the upstream and 
downstream regions of each probe.
<li>What is the minimum count of hits you need to see either upstream
or downstream in order to make a measure of the DI. 
<li>
Whether you want to remove duplicate HiC pairs when counting.

</ol>
