<h1>Subset Normalisation Quantitation</h1>

<p>
The subset normalisation quantitaion can be used to normalise any quantitation
to a specific subgroup of probes which would be expected not to change between 
your conditions.  This could be something like a set of housekeeping genes, or 
a set of regions which you have experimentally profiled by some other means to
determine that they are not changing and can act as suitable controls.  The 
combined data from all of the probes in the chosen subset will be used as the 
basis for the correction.
</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<ol>
<li>You can choose which value, the mean or the sum, of the probes in the subset
is to be used as the basis for the normalisation</li>
<li>You can choose whether the target value for the normalisation is the largest
summed value in the set of chosen probes (so all corrections are positive), or
you can opt to normalise to a fixed value of 1</li>
<li>You can choose the method by which the target value is to be achieved - this
can either by by addition or multiplication.</li>
</ol>
