<h1>The HiC Length Histogram</h1>

<p>
The HiC length histogram can be used to view the distribution of distances
between opposing ends of HiC interactions. The plot is can therefore only
be drawn from HiC data stores.

<p>
The plot only uses data from pairs of HiC ends which sit on the same 
chromosome.  Pairs on different chromosomes are ignored.  The distance
plotted is the minimal distance between the ends of the individually mapped
reads.  Ends which overlap are shown with a distance of zero.
</p>
<p>
The plot can be drawn by selecting &quot;Plots &gt; HiC Length Histogram&quot; from the 
main menu, or by right-clicking on a HiC data store in the Data view and
selecting &quot;Show HiC Length Histogram&quot;
</p>
<p>
As with all histogram plots you can zoom into any region of the plot by dragging the
mouse over a region of the x-axis.  You can zoom out by pressing the right mouse 
button in the plot area.
</p>
<p>
When selecting this plot from the main menu you can choose whether to use all reads
in the active datastore, or only those which overlap with the currently selected
probe list.
