<h1>The BoxWhisker Plot</h1>

<p>
The BoxWhisker Plot is a view designed to let you compare the
distribution of probe values across several data stores, or
several probe lists across a single data store.
</p>

<p>
To create a BoxWhisker plot select Plots &gt; Box Whisker Plot
from the main menu.  You can then choose whether you want the plot
to show all visible data stores for the currently active probe list
or whether you want to select a set of probe lists to plot for the
currently active data store. The plot window will appear immediately and
the individual plots will appear as they are calculated.  This 
may take a few seconds for larger data sets.
</p>

<p>
The boxwhisker plot shows several different pieces of information.
</p>
<ol>
<li>The line across the middle of the yellow box shows the median</li>
<li>The upper and lower extremities of the yellow box show the
25th and 75th percentile of the set of data</li>
<li>The upper and lower black whiskers show the median plus/minus the
interquartile (25-75%) range multiplied by 2</li>
<li>Any individual points which fall outside this range are shown as
filled circles.  Each circle represents a single probe.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Where multiple plots are drawn they will all be placed onto the same
scale so you can quickly compare between them.
</p>
<p>
Within the BoxWhisker plot menu you can choose to plot either:
</p>
<ul>
<li>One probe list against the currently visible set of DataStores</li>
<li>The currently active data store against a selected set of probe lists</li>
<li>A set of probe lists against the currently visible data stores (in this case
you can choose within the plot if the data stores or the probe lists go on
the x-axis)</li>


<p>
If you want to extract the list of outliers from the boxwhisker plot
you can use the 
<a href="../../5%20Filtering/5.2%20Statistical%20Filters/5.2.1%20BoxWhisker%20Filter.html">BoxWhisker Filter</a>
to pull them out as a probe list.
