<h1>The Line Graph</h1>

<p>
The line graph is a way to look at the pattern of quantitation of a set of
probes over the currently visible data stores.  It is an easy way to visually
assess the consistency of replicates, or look for gradual trends which occur
over a set of stores.

<h2>Options</h2>
<p>
You can choose to show data for only the currently active probe list, or you
can select a set of probe lists and draw line graphs for each of them.  The
data stores shown will be those which are currently visible in the chromosome
view.  Only quantiated data stores can appear in the graph, so any stores 
which are not quantitated will be silently dropped from the plot.
</p>
<p>
The default view plots the range of values as they appear in the current 
quantiation.  One option to clean up the graph is to apply a per probe
normalisation to the graph.  In this case the plot for each probe is 
stretched so its dynamic range runs from the bottom to the top of the plot
window. This has the effect of emphasising the changes between conditions
whilst ignoring the magnitude of the differences.  If you want to look
at aligned profiles whilst keeping the magnitude differences then you should
look at the per-probe normalisation option in the data quantitation. 
</p>
<p>
In some cases you will have so many probes that the plot becomes cluttered
and it's not clear what the overall trend of the group is.  In this case you
can choose the 'summarise graph' option.  Instead of showing the individual
traces this will show only the mean value for each data store, along with
error bars indicating the 95% confidence interval for the measure.
