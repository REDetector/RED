<h1>The Status Bar</h1>
<p><img src="status_bar.png" alt="The Status Bar"></p>
<p>
The status bar is a notification area which usually shows
relevant information for whatever object your mouse is over
at the time.
</p>
<p>
Near the right hand end of the status bar is a small graph showing
SeqMonk's current memory usage.  It is worth keeping an eye on your
memory usage since running out of memory will cause SeqMonk to run
very slowly, and eventually to stop altogether.
</p>
<p>
The memory usage graph is in three parts:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The red part indicates the memory currently being used by SeqMonk.</li>
<li>The orange part indicates memory which SeqMonk has reserved but isn't currently using</li>
<li>The green part indicates memory which is available to SeqMonk but it isn't using.</li>
</ol>
<p>
To get an accurate view of the current memory usage you can double click on this graph
which will cause SeqMonk to pause and clean up all of its memory.  What you then see
will be the actual amount of memory which is being consumed by the program.  At other times
the usage will include inactive memory which SeqMonk hasn't got round to cleaning up.
</p>
<p>
The percentage value shown is the percentage of total available memory (green) which
is currently being used (red).  When this percentage reaches 90% you will get a warning
since you are coming close to running out of available memory.  In this case you should 
look at the
<a href="../../8%20Configuration/8.2%20Memory%20Settings.html">memory settings</a> and 
<a href="../../8%20Configuration/8.1%20SeqMonk%20Preferences.html">preferences</a>
documentation to see how you can enable more memory or reduce the amount of memory SeqMonk requires.
</p>
<p>
At the right hand end of the bar is a small icon which shows the current status of your
disk cache.  If this icon is red then caching is not being used.  If it is green then
caching is enabled but inactive.  If it is orange then caching is enabled and data is currently
being read from the cache.  You can double click on this icon to turn disk caching on/off, but
the change will not take effect until SeqMonk is restarted.
