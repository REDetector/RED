<h1>Searching</h1>

<p>
    Rather than manually moving around the genome there are a couple of
    different search tools you can use to quickly take you to a region
    of interest.
</p>

<h2>Goto Position</h2>

<p>
    If you know the genomic coordinates of the region you want to go to
    you can select Edit &gt; Goto position and manually enter the position
    you want to see. The chr view will immediately update to show
    this region.
</p>

<h2>Search for Features</h2>

<p>
    If you want to find a particular annotation feature then you can use
    the Find Feature tool. To launch this you select Edit &gt; Find Feature.
</p>

<p>
    The find feature tool searches for a single word or phrase in the
    annotation for all of the features in the current genome. You can limit
    your search to just the feature names, or you can search through the
    whole set of annotation. You can also limit your search to a particular
    type of feature.
</p>

<p>
    Once you have a list of results you can sort these by clicking on any
    of the column headers in the results table.
</p>

<p>
    If you want to see a feature in the chr view you can double
    click on any line of the feature results and the view will immediately
    jump to show the region covered by that feature.
