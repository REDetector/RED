<h1>Movement Controls</h1>
<p>
Much of your time working with SeqMonk will be spent moving around the chromosome
view.  There are a simple set of movement controls performed using the mouse
which allow you to quickly find your region of interest and show the information
you want to see.
</p>
<h2>Basic Movement Controls</h2>
<h3>Zooming in and out</h3>
<p>
Zooming is usually performed using the mouse.  To zoom into a region simply click
and drag the mouse over the area you want to see.  As you drag you will see a 
green box appear on the display, and when you release the mouse this green region
will be expanded to fill the entire view.

<p>
To zoom out simply press the right mouse button (apple+click on a mac).  The
view will expand to show you twice as much sequence as you could see before.
</p>

<h3>Moving Laterally</h3>
<p>
Often the easiest way to move laterally along a chromosome is to zoom out and
then select the new region you want to see.  Alternatively you can drag the
scroll bar which appears under the chromosome to quickly scan along the current
region.
</p>

<h2>Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
<p>
If you prefer to use the keyboard to move around the genome you can do this.  The
available keyboard shortcuts are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Move right: Right Arrow</li>
<li>Move left: Left Arrow</li>
<li>Zoom in: Up arrow</li>
<li>Zoom out: Down arrow</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changing chromosome</h2>
<p>
To change chromosome simply click on the chromosome you want to view in the 
genome view.  The chromosome view will change to show the region you clicked
on.  You can also use this method to quickly jump to a different region of
the same chromosome.
