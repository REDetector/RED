This is the default Genomes Folder.  New Genomes which are downloaded by SeqMonk will
automatically be added to this folder and kept for future use.

Genones are stored in an ordered structure based on Species and then Assembly.  To
remove an installed genome simply delete the folder whose name corresponds to the
species/assembly you want to delete.
