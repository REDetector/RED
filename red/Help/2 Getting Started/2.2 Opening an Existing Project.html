<p>
    To open an existing project, select <i>File &gt; Open Project</i> from the main menu. All RED project files use a .red file extension. A RED project stor
    es all of the Data Set, Data Group, Probe Set and Probe List information for your project. It also remembers which data tracks were visible. See <em>
    <a href="../6%20Saving%20Data/6.1%20Saving%20a%20Project.html">Saving a Project</a></em> section for more details. </p>

<p>Although it stores the name of the genome you were using, it doesn't contain the actual genome data. If you are using RED on a new machine, it will
    automatically download and install the required genome when you open a project file. If you want to use RED when not connected to a network, you need to
    ensure that the correct genome has been installed locally. Once downloaded, genomes will be cached on your machine for future use.</p>
