<h4>2.1.1 Select a Genome</h4>

<p>
    To start a new project, you may first select a new genome of interest. When the program is open, select <em>File &gt; New Project…</em> to select a new
    genome. If there isn't any genome file in the local host, a warning notification will pop up as the following illustrated and tell you what you should do.

<p>If you choose to download a new genome, click Import New button and find out the new genome you need.</p>

<p>After the download completes, the following dialog of <em>Select Genome…</em> will pop up.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that it may take a little bit longer when importing genome data into RED for the first time. We have a cache mechanism to make it faster
    when you reload the same genome. Once you have selected your genome and it has been loaded, you can move on to the next step.</p>
