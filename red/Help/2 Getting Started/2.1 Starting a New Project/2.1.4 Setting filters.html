<h4>2.1.4 Setting Filters</h4>

<p>Eight kinds of filters have been provided in RED, see <a href="../../4%20Filters/4%20Filters.html"><em>Filters</em></a> section for more detail. Before
    setting filters, database must be connected successfully. An initial set of RNA-editing sites (ProbeSet) will be present as a root tree named All Probes
    within <a href="../../3%20Visualisation/3.3%20Directory%20Panel.html"><em>Directory Panel</em></a>.
    When one filter is executed, a leaf connected to this tree will be generated associated with the remaining RNA-editing sites.</p>

<p>For the tested data, we have imported BJ22.RNA.chr8.snvs.vcf and BJ22.RNA.chr8.snvs.bam file into database which has 9530 candidate RNA-editing sites.</p>

<p class="imgname">Fig. 2.10 RNA-seq data and potential RNA editing sites within Directory Panel</p>

<p>Then we execute the <em><a href="../../4 Filters/4.2%20Quantitation%20Methods/4.2.2%20Basic%20Filter.html">Basic Filter</a></em> with quality greater than 20
    and coverage greater than 6.</p>

<p>After filtration (for a few seconds), there is a subset of editing sites remained and a leaf will be produced within
    <a href="../../3%20Visualisation/3.3%20Directory%20Panel.html"><em>Directory Panel</em></a> to describe and check what you have filtered out as illustrated
    below. At the same time, the <a href="../../3%20Visualisation/3.4%20Genome%20Panel.html"><em>Genome Panel</em></a> and
    <a href="../../3%20Visualisation/3.5%20Chromosome%20Panel/3.5%20Chromosome%20Panel.html"><em>Chromosome Panel</em></a> will present the RNA-editing
    sites by different colours.</p>
