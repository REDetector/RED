<h1>Grouping Samples</h1>

<p>
    In many experiment designs it makes sense to group together a set of
    samples so they are treated as a single data store. There are two
    ways to group samples in SeqMonk and they serve different purposes.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>DataGroups: A data group is a way to merge together data from multiple
        data sets, where the data should be considered as a single biological sample.
        You would use this if, for example, you did several sequencing runs on the
        same library and wanted to be able to look at the results all together.
        DataGroups can be quantitated but they can't be used to assess the reproducibility
        of the values in the datasets from which they are built.
    </li>
    <li>Replicate Sets: A replicate set is a way to group together DataSets and
        DataGroups which represent biological replicates of related samples. They don't
        store any data and they aren't quantitated - their quantiation merely shows the
        mean of the quantitated values for their component DataStores. Replicate Sets
        are used to provide sample grouping for statistical filters which compare two
        groups of samples.
    </li>


    <p> Because quantitation in SeqMonk must be performed on both DataSets and
        DataGroups it is important that you create your groups as early as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can create data groups by selecting Data &gt; Edit Groups. You can make
        as many groups as you like and assign as many samples as you like to each
        group. If it makes sense you can assign the same sample to more than one
        group - for example in the screenshot below the Male WT sample could be
        part of the male and WT groups.
    </p>

    <p>
        The data group editor allows you to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create New groups</li>
        <li>Add or remove samples from existing groups</li>
        <li>Rename groups</li>
        <li>Delete Groups (note that this will NOT delete the samples in the group)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you need to create groups in your experiment then it's a good idea to
        put all samples into groups (even if the group only contains one DataSet). This
        is beacuse when you come to doing quantitation this will act by default on
        just the DataGroups if you have any defined (although you can change this if
        you need to).
    </p>

    <p>
        You create replicate sets in much the same way as data groups. First select
        Data &gt; Edit Replicate Sets and then from the dialog which opens you can
        create or delete replicate sets and add or remove DataStores from sets which
        already exist. You can put a data store into more than one replicate set if
        this makes sense for your data.
