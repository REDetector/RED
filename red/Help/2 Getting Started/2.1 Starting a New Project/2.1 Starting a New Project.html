<p>Before starting a new project, make sure that you have configured all running environments mentioned in the
    <a href="../../1%20Introduction/1.2%20Prerequisites.html"><em>Prerequisites</em></a> section. You can either select a genome or connect to MySQL database
    when starting a new project, but both should be performed to make the program work properly.</p>
