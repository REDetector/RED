<h1>SeqMonk Terminology</h1>
<p>
There are a few terms used throughout the SeqMonk documentation which it is
useful to understand before using the program.
</p>
<h2>Data Set</h2>
<p>
A data set refers to a set of regions imported from a single file.  These regions
should all come from a single biological condition, but they may not be the only
regions to come from that condition.
</p>

<h2>Data Group</h2>
<p>
A data group is a way of merging together two or more DataSets. When data from one
biological sample is present in more that one DataSet you can use a DataGroup to
combine them together.  A Data Group does not copy the original data it
just transparently aggregates two or more data sets, but it will store its own
quantitation information.
</p>

<h2>Replicate Set</h2>
<p>
A replicate set is a way of grouping together DataSets or DataGroups which come
from different instances of the same biological condition.  As with the Data Group
it does not copy any sequence data which is just taken from the underlying data
sets, and it does not store its own quantiation information, it merely averages
the quantitations present in the underlying data sets or groups.
</p>

<h2>Data Store</h2>
<p>
A Data Store simply refers to either a data set, data group or replicate set in a 
situation where it doesn't matter which one you have.  Most analyses and displays 
in SeqMonk operate on Data Stores and they work equally well with either Data Sets,
Data Groups or replicate sets.
</p>

<h2>Probe</h2>
<p>
A probe is a genomic region in which a quantitated measurement can be made.  Probes
can be defined in a variety of ways using the various Probe Generators available.
After quantitation each probe will have a value for each Data Store.
</p>

<h2>Probe Set</h2>
<p>
A Probe Set is a collection of Probes.  You can have only one active Probe Set in your
analysis and this will be the same for all Data Stores.  Whilst it is possible to
regenerate your Probe Set, doing this will cause you to lose all of the data corresponding
to the Probe Set being replaced.
</p>

<h2>Probe List</h2>
<p>
A Probe List is a subset of your Probe Set.  Probe Lists are produced by the various 
Filters available within SeqMonk.  Each probe in a Probe List can have a value associated
with it.  For example following a statistical filter the Probe List generated might store
the p-value for each Probe in the list.
