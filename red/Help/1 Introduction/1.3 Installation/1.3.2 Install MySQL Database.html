<h4>1.3.2 Install MySQL Database</h4>

<p>RED stores almost all data into database so that we can reuse the data for research. MySQL is one of the best choice since it is free and efficient. Inst
    all MySQL database with the following download page.</p>
<ul>
    <li>MySQL:</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/</a>
</p>

<p>Although default configuration in MySQL can ensure your server works well, you could edit the configure file to gain better performance. For Linux System,
    edit the parameters in the file of /etc/my.cnf (default configuration path). For Windows System, you could use
    <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/"><em>MySQL Workbench</em></a> to configure your server efficiently.</p>
