<h4>1.3.1 Install Java Runtime Environment</h4>

<p>Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is basically the Java Virtual
    Machine (JVM) where your Java programs run on. It also includes
    browser plugins for Applet execution. Java Development Kit (JDK)
    is the full featured Software Development Kit (SDK) for Java,
    including JRE, and the compilers and tools (e.g., JavaDoc, and
    Java Debugger) to create and compile programs. In order to run
    RED, we need to install either JRE or JDK.</p>
