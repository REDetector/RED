<h4>1.3.1 Install Java Runtime Environment</h4>

<p>Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is basically the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) where your Java programs run on. It also includes browser plugins for Appl
    et execution. Java Development Kit (JDK) is the full featured Software Development Kit (SDK) for Java, including JRE, and the compilers and tools (e.g.,
    JavaDoc, and Java Debugger) to create and compile programs. In order to run RED, we need to install either JRE or JDK.</p>
