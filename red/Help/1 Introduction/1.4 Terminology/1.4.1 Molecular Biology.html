<h4>1.4.1 Molecular Biology</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>RNA Editing</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>RNA editing is one of the post- or co-transcriptional processes with modification of RNA nucleotides from their genome-encoded sequence.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Reference Genome</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Reference genome is a comprehensive, integrated, non-redundant, well-annotated set of reference sequences including genomic, transcript, and protein
    (hg19).</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sequence Alignment Map (<i>.bam/.sam</i>) File
    </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>SAM format is a text format for storing sequence data in a series of tab delimited ASCII columns, while BAM format stores the same data in a compressed,
    indexed, binary form.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Variant Calling Format (<i>.vcf</i>) File
    </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>VCF is a text file format (most likely stored in a compressed manner) which contains meta-information lines, a header line, and then data lines each
    containing information about a position in the genome.</p>
