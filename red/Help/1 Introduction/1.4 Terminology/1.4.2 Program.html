<h4>1.4.2 Program</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Set</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A data set stores a set of data, which is imported from a single file. It is an efficient way to be handled and presented. In program, a data set refers to a
    BAM/SAM file that contains sequence alignment/map information, which is displayed in the context of reference sequence.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Group</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A data group contains two or more data sets with different biological conditions to make it compared for some purposes (e.g., comparing RNA editing sites
    identified in cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues). In a given data group, we aggregate data sets needed for research and save the results of
    comparison. This function has not completely worked , and we will try our best to make it come true in the next version.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Store</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A data store refers to either a data set or a data group. Most analyses and visualizations in RED operate on data stores and they work equally well with
    either data sets or data groups.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Probe/ProbeBean</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
    A probe represents a potential RNA editing site which contains basic information (e.g., coordinate, reference base and editing base), while a probe bean
    contains all information derived from <i>.vcf</i> file.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Probe Set</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A probe set stores all probes from an initial vcf file, namely stores all RNA editing sites without using any filter. It is also the root of a pipe
    line tree when executing any filter to the original probe set. The probe set is produced when a vcf file has been input into database.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Probe List</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A probe list is a subset of the probe set. Probe lists are generated by one or more filters implemented in RED, which store the remaining editing site
    s after filtration. However, we can produce probe lists from another probe list which had executed one or more filters.</p>
