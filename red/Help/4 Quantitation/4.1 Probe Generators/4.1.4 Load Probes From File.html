<h1>Load probes from File</h1>

<p>
The load probes from file generator used to allow you to directly load in
a set of positions to use for probes from a specially formatted text file.
</p>
<p>
This generator has now been removed since a better way to achieve this end
is to use the more flexible annotation import tools to import the set of
positions as an annotation track, and then use the feature probe generator
to make probes over the imported features.
