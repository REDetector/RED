<h1>MACS Peak Caller Probe Generator</h1>

<p>
The MACS Peak Caller probe generator uses the methodology original used in
MACS (Genome Biology 2008,9:R137) to do a statistically based peak calling
suitable for use in ChIP-Seq samples where you have classical small focussed
enrichment peaks. 
</p>
<p>
The MACS methodology initially identifies a set of high-confidence peaks 
which exhibit between 20-100 fold enrichment in reads and then uses these
to model the average distance between reads on the two DNA strands.
</p>
<p>
It next uses a binomial distribution to remove duplicate tags which are
represented at statisically unlikely levels within the sample. 
</p>
<p>
Next it generates a full set of candidate peaks by comparing the enrichment
within windows to a poisson distribution modelled on the data density in
the entire dataset.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the candidate peaks are checked against custom poisson distributions
generated from the local environment around each peak at distances of 5 and 10kb.
These local distributions can be calculated either from the ChIP sample, or from
a matched control sample which you can use.  For the matched control a distribution
at 1kb is also calcualted.  The most conservative answer from all of the different
distributions tried is finally used to assess the quality of the peak.
</p>

<h2>Options</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can specify the p-value threshold used to decide if the enrichment in a peak is
significant</li>
<li>You can choose the average fragment size in your library, which will determine the
size of window which is used to identify peaks within your sample</li>
<li>You can choose which samples will be taken for the ChIP and input samples.  Chosen
samples will be merged together for the analysis</li>
