<h1>Current Region Probe Generator</h1>

<p>
The current region probe generator places a single probe over the exact region
which is currently visible in the chromosome view.  It can be useful when you
want to make a single measurement in your data.  It is also useful in combination
with the Running Window Probe Generator option to 'only design within active probe
list' to allow you to put high resolution tiled probes in a specific region of
the genome.  This can be useful for making high quality plots for papers or
presentations.
</p>

<h2>Options</h2>
<p>This generator has no options.  It also ignores the 'discard probes with
no data' option if that has been set, since it only makes one probe anyway.</p>
