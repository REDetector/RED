<h1>4C Enrichment Quantitation</h1>

<p>
The 4C enrichment quantitation method is a specialised method which is only suitable
for analysing datasets which were generated by the HiC other ends import filter from 
a HiC dataset.  The method uses the same statistical model used to calculate enrichment
for HiC datasets, but applies this as a linear quantitation of a 4C dataset.  Each
probe is assigned a value which indicates its level of enrichment relative to the 
expected level of observation given its coverage and distance from the 4C bait
region used to create the dataset.
