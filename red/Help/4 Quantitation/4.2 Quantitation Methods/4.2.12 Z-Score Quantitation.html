<h1>Z-Score Quantitation</h1>

<p>
The Z-Score quantitaion requires that you have quantitated your
data already using one of the other quanitation methods.  It
is a way of matching data which are roughly normally distributed
but with different variances.

<p>
The z-score is a measure of deviation from the mean given the
standard deviation.  Traditional z-scores simply convert each
value into the number of standard deviations from the mean.
</p>
<p>
The Z-Score used in this quantitation is the modified Z-Score
proposed by Inglewicz and Hoaglin.  Instead of being based on
the mean it uses the median, and instead of standard deviation
it used the median of absolute deviation about the median (MAD).
MAD is more stable to the effects of small numbers of outliers
which are often seen in HTS data.
</p>
<p>
Generally z-scores with an absolute value of &gt3.5 are considered
potential outliers from a normal distribution.
