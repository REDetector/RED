<h1>Per Probe Normalisation Quantitation</h1>

<p>
Per probe normalisation is a way of adjusting a set of quantitations
to emphasise the differences between different data stores, whilst
removing any overall differences in average quantitation level.
</p>
<p>
The quantitation adjustment works by adjusting the medians of each probe
to be the same across the set of stores which are being normalised.
</p>

<h2>Options</h2>
<p>
You can choose how this normalisation is applied.  You can either subtract
the median value from each individual value, or you can divide by the
median and log2 transform the result.  You should choose subtract if you
data was already quantitated on a log scale, and divide if it wasn't.  In
each case your probes will have a median of 0.  Alternatively you can scale
your data so that each probe has a value between 0 and 1 where 0 is the lowest
value for that probe across all datasets, and 1 is the highest value.
