<h1>Coverage Depth Quantitation</h1>

<p>
The coverage depth quantitation quantitates your data based on the depth
of overlapping reads within each probe.
</p>
<p>
This kind of quantitation can be useful for resequencing experiments to 
find underrepresented regions.  It is also useful in a variety of experiments
to filter out sequences which are overrepresented.  These are often the
result of biased amplification or mismapping and can skew the results of any
subsequent analysis.

<h2>Options</h2>
<p><img src="coverage_depth_quantitation.png" alt="Coverage Depth Quantitation Picture"></p>
<p>The options you have for this module are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whether you want to calculate the maximum or minimum depth of coverage.</li>
<li>Whether you are interested in any kind of overlap, or only exact overlaps 
where the start and end points (though not the strand) are exactly the same</li>
<li>Whether you want a raw count for the number of overlapping reads, or 
if you want to express this as a percentage of the total number of reads in
this probe.
</li>
</ol>
