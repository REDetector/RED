<h1>Distance to Feature Quantitation</h1>

<p>
This quantitation methods simply quantitates each probe with the distance to
the nearest member of a class of selected features.  Since the quantitation
doesn't depend on the data in each data store every data store will get the
same quantitated values.

<p>
You can choose whereabouts in the probe you want to start your measurement and
where in the feature it should end.  All distances are absolute (no negative
distances allowed).  You can also opt to log2 transform your distances if the
distances involved are going to be large.
</p>
<p>
Any probe on a chromosome which doesn't contain an instance of the feature being
searched against will be assigned the length of the chromosome.
