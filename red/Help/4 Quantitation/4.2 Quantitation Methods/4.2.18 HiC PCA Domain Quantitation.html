<h1>HiC PCA Domain Quantitation</h1>

<p>
The PCA domain quantitation is a method which can be used to try to identify
local interaction domains within a HiC dataset.  It constructs a HiC interaction
set using the same options as for the HiC heatmap plot, and then performs a 
principal components analysis of this data to identify the first principal 
component.  Each probe is then quantitated with the eigenvalue for this
principal component.

<p>
This method of quantitation should allow you to see local interaction domains, which
should have similar eigenvalues in a locally clustered region, and should show 
a sharp shift when a move to a different domain occurs.  The efficacy of this
type of partitioning strategy is entirely dependent on which factor in your data
is identified as the principal component in this analysis.
