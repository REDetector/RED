<h1>Fixed Value Quantitation</h1>

<p>
The fixed value quantitation simply assigns the same value to every probe
in every data store.  It is a very quick quantitation method which is useful
if you want to be able to see your probes but don't yet need a proper
quantitation calculated from the actual data.
</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<p>
The only option is the value you wish to assign to each probe.  If you don't
specify a value then 1 is assined to each probe.
