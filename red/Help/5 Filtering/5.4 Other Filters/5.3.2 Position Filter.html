<h1>Position Filter</h1>
<p>
This filter allows you to select only probes which fall into a
particular genomic region.

<h2>Options</h2>
<p>
The only options to the position filter are the chromosome you want to
use and the start and end position of the region in which you want to
select probes.
</p>
<p>
When the position filter first opens it will fill in the options boxes
using the boundaries of the region currently being displayed in the 
chromosome view.
</p>
<p>
When applying the filter only probes which are completely contained within
the region will be selected.  Probes which overlap the start or end of the
region will not be included in the filtered set.
