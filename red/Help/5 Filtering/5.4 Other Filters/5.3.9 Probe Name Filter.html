<h1>Probe Name Filter</h1>
<p>
The probe name filter allows you to supply a list of text query strings and these
will be searched against the list of probe names and any matches will be selected.
</p>
<p>
All matches made by this filter are case insensitive
</p>

<h2>Options</h2>
<ol>
<li>You can choose to remove additions which SeqMonk would have placed on the end
of feature names when using them to create probes (eg _upstream, _downstream or _gene).</li>
<li>You can remove transcript suffixes (eg -001, -002) to allow matches to transcripts from
gene names</li> 
</ol>
