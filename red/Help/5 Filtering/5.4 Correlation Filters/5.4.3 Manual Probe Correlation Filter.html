<h1>Manual Probe Correlation Filter</h1>
<p>
The manual probe correlation filter operates in a similar way to the probe list
correlation filter, in that it allows you to find probes which show correlation
to a set of reference quantitation profiles across several Data Stores.  The difference
in the manual filter is that the reference profiles are generated interactively
so you can construct whichever quantitation profiles you like.

To create a correlation profile simply select the data stores you want to use from
the list on the left and then drag the green boxes on the profile plot to generate
the profile you wish to correlate against.  You can filter against up to 12 profiles
simultaneously. If a probe is able to correlate against more than one of the constructed
profiles then it will be added to the profile with the highest correlation (or lowest
if your correlation cutoff is less than 0).  In this way you can ensure that you get
no overlap between correlation clusters.

<h2>Options</h2>

<ul>
<li>You can choose which data stores you want to use for your correlation.  You
must choose at least 3 stores and there is no upper limit to the number you choose.</li>
<li>You can choose how many manual profiles you want to create</li>
<li>You must generate your reference profiles using the selected data stores.</li>
<li>You can choose how correlated a probe has to be to the reference profile in order
to be included in the filtered output.  If you specify a negative R value then the
filter will search for correlation less than that value, so this becomes an anti-correlation filter</li>
</ul>
