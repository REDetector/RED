<h1>Probe List Correlation Filter</h1>
<p>
Where you have several datastores and a probe list which shows a concerted
pattern of quantitation across those stores (for example a cluster group
defined by the correlation cluster filter) you can use the probe list
correlation filter to take the average quantitation profile from this list
and search for other probes which have a correlated quantitation profile
</p>
<p>
This filter would be useful where you initially used a stringent subset of
genes to create initial clusters, but later wanted to expand the coverage
to a larger set of probes.
</p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<ul>
<li>You can choose which data stores you want to use for your correlation.  You
must choose at least 3 stores and there is no upper limit to the number you choose.</li>
<li>You must choose the probe list you want to use as your reference for your quantitation
profile.</li>
<li>You can choose how correlated a probe has to be to the reference profile in order
to be included in the filtered output.  If you specify a negative R value then the
filter will search for correlation less than that value, so this becomes an anti-correlation filter</li>
</ul>
