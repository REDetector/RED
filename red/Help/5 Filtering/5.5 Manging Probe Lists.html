<h1>Managing Probe Lists</h1>
<p>
When you run a filter you will create a new probe list.  You will always be
prompted for what you call your new list although a default name will be
provided.
</p>
<p>
Probe lists go into your Data View, and are always stored in alphabetical
order.  If you select a probe list in the Data View then the chromosome
view will change to show you just the probes contained in the list.  Any 
further filters you run will also use the current probe list as their
starting point and any lists they create will be a subset of the currently
selected list.
</p>
<p>
Probe lists only apply to the current ProbeSet.  If for any reason you choose
to redefine your ProbeSet then you will loose all of the probe lists you
generated with the old ProbeSet.
</p>
<p>
If you want to rename a probe list you can do this by right-clicking on it
and selecting rename.  You can right-click on a probe list and select 
delete to permanently remove it.
