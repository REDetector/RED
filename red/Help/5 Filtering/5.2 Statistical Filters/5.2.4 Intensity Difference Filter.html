<h1>Intensity Difference Filter</h1>
<p>
The intensity difference filter is a simple filter which can be used to compare two
or more data stores.  It can assign a p-value to each individual probe without the
need for replicates.  It is designed to work with datasets which are largely similar,
but which show an intensity dependent effect on the variability within the data, normally
such that higher values show lower variability and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
The filter works by constructing a local distribution of differences from probes with
similar average intensity to the probe being examined.  The set of differences is then
modelled with a normal distribution and this model is used to assign a probability of
the probe being examined falling within that distribution.  At low intensities the 
differences distribution will tend to show high variability, and at high intensities
the variability will be lower, so the p-values calculated take this change in variability
into account.
</p>

<p>
The number of probes in the local distribution is either 1% of the total probes examined,
or 100 probes, whichever is the larger.  Where multiple data stores are selected then all
possible pairwise combinations of stores are examined, and the lowest p-value from that
set is assigned to the probe.
</p>

<h2>Options</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can set the p-value threshold below which probes will be kept.</li>
<li>You can choose whether to apply Benjamini and Hochberg multiple testing correction.  The
use of multiple testing correction is required when this test is providing a primary p-value
for any analysis, but can be omitted in some cases where this is used as a secondary filter
akin to a dynamic fold change filter, and where the p-value will not be reported.</li>
<li>You can pick the number of points which will be sampled to make up the distribution used 
for testing.  This value will initially be calculated as 1% of your total probes, or a minimum
of 100 probes, but you can change this to a different value if you think the default is 
inappropriate for some reason</li>
</ul>
