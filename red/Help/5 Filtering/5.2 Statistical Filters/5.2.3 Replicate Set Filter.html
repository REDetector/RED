<h1>Replicate Set Filter</h1>
<p>
The replicate set filter can be used to look for a consistent effect
across a set of biological replicates.  It uses either a t-test or an Anova to
assess whether a set of replicates shows a significant difference either to
one or more other sets, or from a distribution with a mean of zero.

<h2>Options</h2>
<ul>
<li>You need to select one or more Replicate Sets from the list on the left. Only
quantitated replicate sets containing 3 or more data stores will be shown.  If you
select a single set you will be comparing to a mean of 0.  Selecting two sets performs a
t-test between the two sets of data and selecting more than two performs an Anova.</li>
<li>You need to select a p-value cutoff.  Probes where the
p-value is below the cutoff will be included in the filtered set.</li>
<li>The multiple testing correction option will adjust your p-value using a Benjamini
and Hochberg correction to take account of the number of tests you have performed.  Raw
p-values are only valid for a single test, and if you perform multiple tests you must
correct your p-values to get an accurate representation of the significance of your results.</li>
</ul>
