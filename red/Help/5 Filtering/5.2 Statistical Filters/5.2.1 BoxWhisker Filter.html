<h1>BoxWhisker Filter</h1>
<p>
This filter provides a method of identifying outlier probes based
on their position in the whole distribution of probe values.  It is based
on a BoxWhisker plot and is therefore applicable to any kind of distribution
of probe values.

<h2>Options</h2>
<ul>
<li>You need to select one or more DataStores from the list on the left.  Data
Sets are shown in red and Data Stores are shown in Blue.</li>
<li>You need to select a stringency.  The formula for picking a cutoff for
outliers is the median +/- the interquartile range x the stringency.  A stringency
of 1.5 is usual for defining outliers.  A stringency of 3 is often used for distant
outliers, but you can pick any value you feel to be appropriate</li>
<li>If you have selected more than one DataStore for the filter you need to
define in how many stores a probe needs to be an outlier before it goes into the
filtered set.  You can express this using an Exact, At least or No More Than cutoff.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For a visual representation of the outliers in your dataset you can use the
<a href="../../3%20Visualisation/3.2%20Figures%20and%20Graphs/3.2.1%20The%20BoxWhisker%20Plot.html">BoxWhisker Plot</a>.
This shows a BoxWhisker plot with a stringency of 2.
