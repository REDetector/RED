<h1>Saving Quantitation Annotation Tracks</h1>

<p>
    Having created a set of quantiations in SeqMonk you can choose to export these
    in a format which would allow them to be imported into other genome browsers
    (UCSC etc) or systems (IGV etc).
</p>

<p>
    The data is exported in bedGraph format which can easily be converted to bigWig
    format if you prefer using the free tools availble from UCSC.
</p>

<p>
    To export your data select File &gt; Export Current View &gt; BEDGraph. The
    quantitated data for the currently selected Probe List and the currently active
    data store will be saved.
