<p>When you generate a report or a probe list you can choose to save this. All text based exports in RED are written out as tab-delimited text files. Although
    you can open these in any text editor you can also open them directly in a spreadsheet application which should recognise them and import them whilst
    keeping the structure of the original table.</p>
