<h3 id="section6.1">6.1 Saving a Project</h3>

<p>You can choose to save a project at any point. A RED project file is a single file which saves both your data and many of your display preferences so that
    you can get back to working on your data very quickly.</p>

<p>Data which is stored in a project file is:</p>
<ul>
    <li> The positions of all sequencing reads</li>
    <li> The details of your samples</li>
    <li> The details of your sample groups</li>
    <li> The positions of potential RNA editing sites</li>
    <li> All current probe lists</li>
    <li> The list of currently visible data and feature track</li>
    <li> The current position of the chromosome view</li>
    <li> The current data zoom level</li>
    <li> The current data view (probes+reads, just probes, just reads)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some preferences are not stored in the project file and won't be remembered when the program reopens.</p>
<ul>
    <li> The genome annotation data (this is referenced and will be downloaded from the <a href="http://igv.broadinstitute.org/genomes/genomes.txt"><em>IGV
        server</em></a> if required)
    </li>
    <li> The size and layout of the panels in the current display (in case you open the file on a different sized screen)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have changed any of the details which RED stores in its project file during your session, when you close the program you will be prompted to re-save
    the project before exiting.</p>

<p class="imgname">Fig. 6.1 Save project or not before exiting</p>

<p>You should be aware that because RED has to write out all of the read data when it saves a project that this can take a few minutes to complete if you have
    several large datasets open.</p>
