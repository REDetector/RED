<h4>6.2.3 PNG Images</h4>

<p>PNG images are the default selection. These are bitmap images, which means that you can only edit them in the same way that you would edit a photograph. You
    can't make these images any larger and they will be produced initially at the same size as you saw them on screen. They are the equivalent of taking a
    screen shot. These images can be opened in almost any program which can handle images, but are probably not of sufficient quality to use for
    publications.</p>
