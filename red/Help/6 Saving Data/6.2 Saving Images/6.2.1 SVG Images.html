<h4>6.2.1 SVG Images</h4>

<p>SVG images are vector images which means that you can blow them up to any size and they will still look smooth. You can also break them apart and edit the
    individual components. SVG images can only be viewed and edited by a more limited range of software but these packages can render high-quality bitmap images
    from the SVG images and these can then be used in publications. We would recommend the free program Inkscape (www.inkscape.org) for editing SVG files, or
    you could use a commercial package such as Adobe Illustrator.</p>
