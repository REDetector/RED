<h4>6.2.2 EPS Images</h4>

<p>Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) is a DSC-conforming PostScript document with additional restrictions which is intended to be usable as a graphics file format.
    Simply, an EPS file is a PostScript program, saved as a single file that includes a low-resolution preview &quot;encapsulated&quot; inside of it, allowing
    some programs to display a preview on the screen. It can be edited by a text editor or any PostScript printer like Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop.</p>
