<p>SeqMonk &amp; Intergrative Genome Viewer (IGV)</p>

<p>We thank <a href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/"><em>SeqMonk</em></a>
    (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/) and <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/"><em>IGV</em></a>
    (http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/). The framework of the GUI in RED is based on SeqMonk, whose GUI is very brief and operating efficiency is fairly high.
    Meantime, the genome annotation data (mainly referred to gene.txt/gene.gtf) in <a
            href="../3%20Visualisation/3.5%20Chromosome%20Panel/3.5.1%20Feature%20track.html"><em>Feature Track</em></a> is obtained from <a
            href="http://igv.broadinstitute.org/genomes/genomes.txt">genome server</a> of IGV when there is no genome file in the local host.</p>

<p>Xing Li: design the software framework, implement layout, present graphic and text output for RNA editing sites, and prepare the software document.</p>

<p>Di Wu: desigh the software framework, implement multiple filters and formal statistical tests in the software, and perform data analysis.</p>

<p>Qi Pan: prepare RNA-seq and WES data for RNA editing sites analyses</p>

<p>Yongmei Sun: design the software framework, and supervise the project.</p>

<p>Keyue Ding: conceive and design the project, prepare the software document, and perform data analysis, and supervise the project. </p>
