<h1>The Probe List Description Report</h1>
<p>
This type of report provides a full description of the way in which a given probe list was generated.
It creates an HTML document which contains the descriptions of the way in which probes were 
generated and quantitated, and the filter options for all of the filters which were run in order
to generate the list being analysed.
</p>
<p>
This kind of report is designed to be a human readable record of an analysis which should be 
sufficiently detailed to allow someone else to repeat the analysis.
</p>
<p>
The report is saved to an HTML file and will then automatically open in your native browser
after it's saved.
