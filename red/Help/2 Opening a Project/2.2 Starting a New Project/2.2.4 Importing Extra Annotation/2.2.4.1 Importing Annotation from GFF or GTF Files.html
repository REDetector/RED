<h1>Importing GFF or GTF Annotation Files</h1>
<p>
GFF and its relative GTF are simple text formats designed to
describe annotation features.  Older versions of GFF were able
to describe only single locus features, but newer versions
are able to link together multiple entries to create split
location features.
</p>
<p>
SeqMonk is able to import annotation tracks from all variants
of GFF or GTF files.
</p>

<h2>Options</h2>
<p>
Since some GFF files (and GTF files in particular) will contain
features of types which will be present in the core annotation 
tracks the GFF importer will allow you to specify a prefix which
will be applied to all of your feature names when they are
imported. So for example if you specify a prefix of &quot;custom_&quot;
then any CDS features will be imported as custom_CDS features so you
can easily tell them apart from the CDS features in the core annotation
set.
