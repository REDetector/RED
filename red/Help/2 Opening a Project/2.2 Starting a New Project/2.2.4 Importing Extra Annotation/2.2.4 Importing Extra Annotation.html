<h1>Importing Extra Annotation</h1>
<p>
Every SeqMonk genome comes with a set of annotation which covers the
most common types of features you're likely to want to view against
the genome (genes, mRNA, CDS etc).  However you may want to import
extra sets of annotation to use in your analysis.
</p>
<p>
Currently SeqMonk supports the import of extra annotation from the
following file formats:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="2.2.4.1%20Importing%20Annotation%20from%20GFFv2%20Files.html">GFFv2 Files</a></li>
<li><a href="2.2.4.2%20Importing%20Annotation%20from%20a%20Probe%20List.html">An existing probe list</a></li>
<li><a href="2.2.4.3%20Importing%20Annotation%20from%20Generic%20Text%20Files.html">A generic delimited text file</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Other formats will be added as and when people request them.
</p>
<p>
Once you import an extra annotation set it will appear in the
AnnotationSets folder of your DataView and any annotation it
provides will immediately become available in the annotation
track selector.  If your set of annotations contains more than
1 million features they will be split up into subsets so you
might see more than one set for each file you import, but the
results will be merged together in the annotation tracks you
see.

<p>
Although annotation sets are stored separately the annotation 
tracks in the chromosome view are split only by the annotation
type and if several annotation sets provide features of the
same type then they will all be merged together in the track
shown in the chromosome view.
</p>
<p>
You can right-click on any annotation set in the data view to
either change its name, see a breakdown of the features it
contains, or delete it from your project.  All extra annotation
information is saved in your project and will be re-imported
the next time the project is opened.
