<h1>Importing an Annotation Set from a Text File</h1>
<p>
If you have genome annotations in a non-standard format then you can use the
generic text import option to bring them in to SeqMonk.
</p>
<p>
The program will present you with a view of the top of your file and series
of contols you can use to tell SeqMonk how to read the format.

<p>
To define your format simply use the drop down boxes on the right to tell
SeqMonk what character is used as a delimiter in your file, and which
columns contain which pieces of information.  To import data the columns of
information you need to supply are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The chromosome</li>
<li>The start position</li>
<li>The end position</li>
</ul>

<p>
All other fields are optional, but can be useful:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The strand - features will be marked as unknown strand if this is not supplied</li>
<li>The type (eg CDS, mRNA)</li>
<li>The name of the feature - this will be the location if no name is supplied</li>
<li>A longer description - this will be blank if not supplied</li>
</ul>

For the type of feature there is also a text box into which you can enter a
type which will be applied to all features imported from the current file.  If you don't
specify a type column or a manual type then the name of the file will be used as
the type.
