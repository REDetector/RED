<h1>Reimporting Existing Data</h1>
<p>
Under some circumstances you may wish to reimport a data store which you already
have loaded in your current SeqMonk project.  You might want to do this to apply
one of the import modification options (removing duplicates, extending reads)
to a data set which you didn't initially modify, or you might want to convert
a data group into a dataset.
</p>

<p>
To reimport a data store simply select it from the data view and then select
File &gt; Import Data &gt; Active Data Store.  You will see the standard
options for single end data import and then your data will be duplicated with
those options applied.  The new data set will have the same name as the original
data store, but with &quot;_reimport&quot; appended to it.
</p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<p>
Generally the options you have when re-importing are the same as you'd see when
importing data from a traditional data source (BAM file etc).  There are a couple
of additional options though.
</p>

<h3>HiC data</h3>
<p>
If the data store you are re-importing is a HiC data store then you will have the
option to either keep this as a HiC dataset, or convert it to a standard dataset
(losing the HiC linkage information).  If you keep the data as HiC you can opt
to ignore reads with paired distances shorter than a cutoff you supply, and you
can choose to completely remove any trans hits from the reimported data.
</p>

<h3>All data</h3>

<p>
You can choose to reverse all of your reads.  This will change forward reads to 
reverse and vice versa.  Reads with no strand information will not be changed.
Please note that reversal of reads happens before the read is extended, so the
extension will effectively happen at the 3' end of the original read if both
of these options are selected.
</p>

<p>
You can filter the imported reads against an annotation track.  You can choose
to keep only reads which overlap a feature type, or exclude those which overlap
a feature type.
