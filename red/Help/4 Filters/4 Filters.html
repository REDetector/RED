<h1 id="chapter4">4 Filters</h1>

<p>RED implemented a variety of different types of filters to reduce false positive rate of the RNA editing sites.<br>
    It is worth spending some time looking through the different filters available. Each filter can be set as your favor. After each step, a set of candidate
    sites will be filtered out and these eliminated sites will be highlighted. Each color stands for one kind of filter. You can easily undo each step.<br>
    With different input data, you will choose <em>de novo</em> mode or Dna/Rna mode.</p>
