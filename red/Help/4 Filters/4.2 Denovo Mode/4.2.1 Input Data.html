<h4>4.2.1 Input Data</h4>

<p>A variant calling format (VCF) file from RNA-seq is necessary. There is no a standard protocol to call sequence variant from RNA-Seq data, although a highly
    accurate approach termed SNPiR has been presented to identify SNPs in RNA-seq data {Piskol:2013fn} Usually, it takes a few minutes to load bam file, while
    DNA sequencing data may take more time. We strongly recommend users follow regular format, some weird vcf file can&rsquo;t be resolved correctly. If your
    vcf file contains more than one sample, please make an annotation before the process. </p>
