<h4>4.2.7 Fisher Exact Test</h4>

<p>First, users need to get R installed, and install the package &ldquo;rjava&rdquo; , and &rdquo;qvalue&rdquo; as below</p>

<p>source (&quot;http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R&quot;)</p>

<p>biocLite(&quot;qvalue&quot;)</p>

<p><em>Please provide the detail of how fisher exact test was performed. </em></p>

<p>R is efficient in performing statistical tests,. P value will be calculated through rJava, andits threshold can be set by user (default: 0.05). We used false
    discovery rate (FDR) to correct for multiple testing (q-value). </p>
