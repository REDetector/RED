<h4>4.2.4 Comprehensive Filter</h4>

<p>On the both edges of each read, bases seems to be with lower quality and mapping can be possibly wrong. As a result, we will filter out intronic sites within
    4 bp of splice junction, which is supposed to be unreliable. Users can set the number of bases on the splice junction. 4 is by default. </p>
