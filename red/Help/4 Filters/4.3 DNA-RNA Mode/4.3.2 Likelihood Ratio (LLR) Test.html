<h4>4.3.2 Likelihood Ratio (LLR) Test</h4>

<p>We used the method in Chepelev {Chepelev:2011ia} to calculate LLR. The ratio between LLR calculated by the current editing level and non-editing level is set
    by user (while 4 is recommended). The number represent probability ratio which can be calculated as pow(10,number). 4 represent 10000 times and 3 represent
    1000 times and so on. The specificity will improve while sensitivity will decline with ratio increasing. </p>
