<p>The <a href="#chapter5"><em>Reports</em></a> section allows you to construct a report based on the filtration and statistical tests illustrated before. The
    reports are based on probeset/probelists or data from database. There are three ways to present RNA-editing sites, which are Variant Distribution, Sites
    Distribution and Filter Reports. The report plot can be exported as described in <a href="../6%20Saving%20Data/6.2%20Saving%20Images.html"><em>Saving
        Images</em></a> section. If you need more RNA-editing sites information, you can export the result in a text format. </p>
