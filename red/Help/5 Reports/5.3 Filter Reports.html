<h3 id="section5.3">5.3 Filter Reports</h3>

<p>We also present the results in a text format. Information about the potential RNA editing sites are listed, including chromosome, position, id, reference
    base, alternative base, quality, editing level, p-value, and FDR. The program will query all information about a probelist generated by filter from database
    and present the result. However, if statistical filter has not been performed, there will not be editing level, p-value and FDR, the value is -1
    instead.</p>
