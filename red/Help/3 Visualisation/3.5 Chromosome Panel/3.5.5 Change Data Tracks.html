<div align="center"><img src="../../img/fig.3.17.png" alt=""></div>

<p class="imgname">Fig. 3.17 Select data tracks displayed on the screen</p>

<p>The list of tracks on the right is the tracks which will be displayed in the chromosome view. The lists on the left are tracks which aren't currently being
    displayed. You can move tracks from one side to another, and move the visible tracks up and down the list to get the set you want.</p>

<p>Within the data track area you can mix DataSets and DataStores however you wish. DataSets are shown with red names and DataGroups with blue names.</p>

<p>In addition to the dialog for changing the displayed data tracks you can also add and remove individual tracks by using the popup menus available in the
    <a href="../3.3%20Directory%20Panel/3.3%20Directory%20Panel.html"><em>Directory Panel</em></a>.</p>
