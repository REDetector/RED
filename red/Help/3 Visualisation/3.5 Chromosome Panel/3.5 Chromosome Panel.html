<h3 id="section3.5">3.5 Chromosome Panel</h3>

<p>The chromosome panel is the most complex view in RED and is also where you're likely to pay the most of your attention to. There are a lot of options for
    changing the information which it showed to you.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="../../img/fig.3.9.png" id="fig_3_9"></div>
<p class="imgname">Fig. 3.9 The chromosome panel when current track length is longer than screen pixel</p>

<p>The view is divided into several tracks. The top of the display is a line of text which tells you which genome and chromosome you are currently viewing. It
    also lists the current position and provides the length of the current view.</p>

<p>Below the text line comes the core genome annotation feature track which has a blue background, the sequence track which is shown with specific status and
    below them is a set of data tracks which have a white/grey background.</p>

<p>Finally at the bottom is a status bar which can display various pieces of information, usually related to the data read position which is currently under the
    mouse.</p>

<p>In the chromosome panel, you can left-click the mouse to zoom in and right-click to zoom out. If you put your mouse over a read it will turn yellow as
    shown follow.</p>
