<h4>3.5.3 Data Track</h4>

<p>Data tracks can show three kinds of information.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The position of the individual mapped reads with block status</li>
    <li>The position of the individual mapped reads with real base information</li>
    <li>The position of RNA editing sites associated with mapped reads</li>
</ul>
<p>It depends on the whole view length of screen whether it displays with blocks or real base information. If the length is longer than the screen pixel, then
    the mapped reads are displayed with blocks. If the length is shorter, then there is enough space to place the base name, so the mapped reads are displayed
    in its real base name.</p>
