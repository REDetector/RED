<p>In the real base status, the reference genome base and mapped read base will appear in the same time. In order to distinguish all bases, we show bases in
    different colours.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="../../../img/fig.3.14.png" alt=""></div>

<p class="imgname">Fig. 3.14 A given sequenced regions with bases shown in different colors</p>
<ul>
    <li>Green = 'A'</li>
    <li>Black = 'G'</li>
    <li>Blue = 'C'</li>
    <li>Red = 'T'</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, it is convenient to discover whether a position has editing base and other editing information. We will provide more editing information with the
    following RED version released.</p>
