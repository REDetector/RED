<h4>3.3.2 Annotation Sets</h4>

<p>The annotation sets folder will only show you an entry for the core genome annotations which come with each imported RED genome. If you import extra
    annotation then this will show up in this folder.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="../../img/fig.3.5.png" alt=""></div>

<p class="imgname">Fig. 3.5 Popup menu of AnnotationSet</p>

<p>Right-clicking on an entry in this folder brings up a popup menu with the following options:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Show Track in Chromosome View</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
    This is a toggle option to turn a track on or off in the chr view. If the track is currently visible you will see a tick next to this option. You can also
    use <em>Edit &gt; Feature Panel</em> option in the main menu.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Properties</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Brings up the number of features in each chromosome in this annotation set.</p>
<ul>
    Rename
</ul>
<p>Allows you to change the name of this annotation set.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Delete</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can delete this annotation from your project (not allowed for Core Genome annotation).</p>
