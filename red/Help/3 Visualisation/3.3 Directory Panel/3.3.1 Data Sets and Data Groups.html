<h4>3.3.1 Data Sets and Data Groups</h4>

<p>As well as seeing your Data Sets and Data Groups you can also use the data view to perform operation on them.</p>

<p>If you click on any DataStore entry in the <a href="3.3%20Directory%20Panel.html"><em>Directory Panel</em></a>, you will see it become highlighted. If that
    DataStore is currently visible in the Chromosome Viewer then it will have a red line at the top and bottom of the track so you can quickly see where it is.
</p>

<p>If you right click (or Apple+click) on any DataStore you will see a popup menu of options appear.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="../../img/fig.3.4.png" alt=""></div>

<p class="imgname">Fig. 3.4 Popup menu of DataSet</p>

<p>The options are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Show Track in Chromosome View</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
    This is a toggle option to turn a track on or off in the chr view. If the track is currently visible you will see a tick next to this option. New tracks are
    added a the end of the current set of tracks. For more flexible options for adding/removing tracks use the <i>View &gt; Set Data Tracks</i> option in the
    main menu.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Rename</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This allows you to change the name of this Data Store.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Delete</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can delete this data store (not allowed for Data Sets).</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Properties</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This shows basic information about your data store, including name, file path, total reads, number of positive reads and negative reads, etc.</p>
