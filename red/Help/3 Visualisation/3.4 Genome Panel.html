<h3 id="section3.4">3.4 Genome Panel</h3>

<p>The genome panel shows an overview of all chromosomes from the reference genome. Once you have performed RNA editing filters, it will show a whole genome
    view of the editing sites. We showed the chromosomes in human only (chromosome 1 to 22, X, Y).</p>

<p class="imgname">Fig. 3.8 Genome panel with RNA editing sites highlighted</p>

<p>A karyogram view of all chromosomes was shown according to their relative sizes. Each rectangle represents a chromosome. The highlighted box shows a region
    currently being shown in the chromosome view. You can use the genome view to move the chromosome view to a different chromosome or to a different region
    of current chromosome.</p>
