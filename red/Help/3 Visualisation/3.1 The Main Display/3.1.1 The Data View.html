<h1>The Data View</h1>

<p>
The data view gives you a quick overview of your DataSets, DataGroups, Replicate
Sets, Annotation sets and ProbeLists.
</p>
<p><img src="data_view.png" alt="The Data View"></p>
<p>
The view consists of a set of folders which can be expanded or collapsed either by
double clicking them or by clicking on the little + or - symbols which may appear
next to them.
</p>
<h2>DataSets, DataGroups and Replicate Sets</h2>
<p>
As well as seeing your DataSets, DataGroups and Replicate Sets you can also use the
data view to perform operations on them.
</p>
<p>
If you click on any DataStore entry in the data view you will see it 
become highlighted.  If that DataStore is currently visible in the chromosome
view then it will have a red line at the top and bottom of the track so you can
quickly see where it is.
</p>
<p>
If you right click (or Apple+click) on any DataStore you will see a 
popup menu of options appear.
</p>
<p><img src="data_view_datastore_popup.png" alt="Popup Menu"></p>
<p>
The options are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Show track in chromosome view:  This is a toggle option to turn a track on or
off in the chromosome view.  If the track is currently visible you will see a tick
next to this option.  New tracks are added a the end of the current set of tracks.
For more flexible options for adding/removing tracks use the View &gt; Set Data Tracks
option in the main menu.
</li>
<li>Show Read Length Histogram: Where you have a range of read sizes in your data it
can be useful to see the distribution of sizes.  Selecting this option will bring up
a histogram showing the abundace of reads of different lengths.</li>
<li>Show Probe Value Histogram: After you have quantitated your data you can use this
option to display a histogram of the range of values assigned to the probes in your
current probe set.</li>
<li>Rename: This allows you to change the name of this DataStore</li>
<li>Delete (Not DataSets): You can delete this data store.</li>
<li>Properties: This will show some basic information about your data store.
</ul>
<h2>Annotation Sets</h2>
<p>
The annotation sets folder will initially only show you an entry for the
core genome annotations which come with each imported SeqMonk genome.  If you
<a href="../../2%20Opening%20a%20Project/2.2%20Starting%20a%20New%20Project/2.2.4%20Importing%20Extra%20Annotation/2.2.4%20Importing%20Extra%20Annotation.html">Import Extra Annotation</a>
then this will show up in this folder.
</p>
<p>
Right-clicking on an entry in this folder brings up a popup menu with the following options:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Properties: Brings up a summary of the types of features in this annotation set</li>
	<li>Rename: Allows you to change the name of this set (not allowed for Core Genome annotation)</li>
	<li>Delete: Deletes this annotation from your project (not allowed for Core Genome annotation)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Probe Lists</h2>
<p>
The set of probe lists will initially be empty until you have created some probes and
run one or more filters to generate some lists.  The lists appear in a heirarchical
tree representing the order in which they were generated.
</p>
<p>
If you select a probe list then your chromosome view will change to show only the probes
which are present in that list.  If you want to change back to seeing all probes again 
you should click on the All Probes list at the root of the tree.
</p>
<p>
As with the DataStores you can right-click (or Apple+click) on a probe list to bring up
a popup menu of options.  These allow you rename or delete this list.  There is also an
option to view the list, you can do this either by selecting this option from the menu, or
by double clicking on the list.  This will generate a dialog which looks like this:
</p>
<p><img src="probe_list_view.png" alt="The Probe List View"></p>
<p>
This is a simple dialog which gives you minimal information about the probes in your list.
But will tell you what filter options were used to create the list.  In the case of the
all probes list you will be told what options were used to create the initial probe set.
You can sort the dialog by clicking on the column headers and can view any probe in the
chromosome view by double clicking on any row of the table.
</p>
<p>
For a more informative view of a probe list you might prefer to use the Annotated Probe
Report or the Probe Group Report.
