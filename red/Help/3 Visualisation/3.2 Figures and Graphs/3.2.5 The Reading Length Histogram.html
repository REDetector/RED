<h1>The Reading Length Histogram</h1>

<p>
The reading length histogram is useful if you have a range of lengths
of read in your data and you'd like to see how they are distributed.
</p>

<p>
You can generate this view by right clicking (or apple+clicking) on one
of the DataStores in the Data View.  You then select Read Length Histogram
from the popup menu.
</p>
<p>
You can change the number of bins in your histogram by dragging the slider
at the top of the window.  You may find that because read lengths are
integers and that the bins operate on fractional numbers you may see bins
which are suddenly larger or smaller than their neighbours.  Playing around
with the number of bins should allow you to get a smooth distribution.
</p>
<p>
If you have a large range of values in your data you can choose to plot the
histogram on a log scale by checking the box on the right.
</p>
<p>
If you put your mouse over any bin you will see the range and count for that
bin appear in the status bar at the bottom.
</p>
<p>
You can zoom into the plot by dragging a box in the plot area. To zoom out
again press the right mouse button (apple+click on a mac)
