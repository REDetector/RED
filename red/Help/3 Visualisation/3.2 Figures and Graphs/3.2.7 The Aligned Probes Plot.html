<h1>The Aligned Probes Plot</h1>

<p>
    The probe trend plot is a useful way to see if there is a universal
    trend which runs over the length of an average probe in a probe
    list. The aligned probes plot is a quick way to see if there are
    subsets of probes within a list which display a pattern over their
    length.

<p>
    Each horizontal line on the plot represents one probe. Because of the
    complexity of calculating these plots, and of limited screen space there
    is a limit of 1000 probes which can be displayed. If you use a list
    containing more than 1000 probes then only the first 1000 probes will
    be used.
</p>

<p>
    The density of colour across each horizontal line reflects the density
    of reads across the probe. The density on each line is normalised to
    be independent of the number of reads in that probe.

<ol>
    <li>You can choose to put the colour density on a log scale</li>
    <li>You can choose to count each read position only once - removing duplicated reads
        from the plot
    </li>
    <li>You can choose which direction of reads to use for your counts</li>
    <li>You can force a plot to be relative (uses 100 slots) rather than using bp resolution
        even if your probes are all the same length. This may make sense if you have very
        long probes
    </li>
</ol>
