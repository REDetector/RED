<h1>The Cumulative Distribution Plot</h1>

<p>
The cumulative distribution plot is a simple way to compare the distribution
of probe values for the same probe list across several data stores, or for
multiple probe lists across the same data store.  In effect it shows a similar
kind of information to the boxwhisker plot, but across the whole distribution,
not just particular points (eg 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles).

<p>
The plot orders the probe values from lowest to highest, and then samples
this set of values at common percetiles through the distribution.  The x-axis
therefore shows how far through the distribution we are looking, and the y-axis
shows the value that the probe in that position has in that data store.
</p>
<p>
This plot is particularly useful when trying to assess the normalisation of 
multiple samples.  Samples which are well normalised with each other will have
very similar profiles on this plot, and any differences seen here indicate a
systematic difference between the samples, which might have either a technical
or a biological source.

The plot can be accessed by selecting &quot;Plots &gt; Cumulative Distribution Plot&quot;
You can choose to either plot all of the currently visible data stores for the 
currently selected probe list, or a selection of probe lists for the active data store
