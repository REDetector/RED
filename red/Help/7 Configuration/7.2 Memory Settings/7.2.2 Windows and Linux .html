<h4>7.2.2 Windows and Linux </h4>

<p>Changing the memory allocation in windows or linux is as simple as passing an extra parameter when launching the program. Instead of starting RED by just
    running 'red' you would run 'red -m XXXX' where XXXX is the amount of memory (in MB) you want to use. </p>
