<p>RED on OS X is distributed as an application bundle, inside which is the configuration file which determines the amount of available memory. To change this
    do the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li> Find the RED application in the Finder.</li>
    <li> Control-click on the application and select &quot;Show package Contents&quot; </li>
    <li> Double click on the contents folder</li>
    <li> Double click the Info.plist file (this will open an application called Property List Editor.</li>
    <li> Look for the line which says 'executable file'</li>
    <li> Edit the value from 'red' to 'red -m XXXXX' where XXXXX is the amount of memory (in B) you want to use.</li>
    <li> Once you've finished, select File &gt; Save to save your changes and then quit PropertyListEditor.</li>
    <li> Restart RED and the new memory limits will be used.</li>
