<h3 id="section7.2">7.2 Memory Settings</h3>

<p>RED works with very large data sets (genome annotations, reference sequence and sequence alignment/map data), and it therefore requires a large amount of
    RAM. </p>

<p>Whilst most aspects of the program can be altered from within RED itself, the total amount of memory available to the program is determined when it is
    started. The RED launcher program will try to determine the optimal amount of memory to assign to RED when it starts, but in some cases, you may need to
    take steps to adjust this. </p>
