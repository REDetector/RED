<h4>7.2.1 General Limitations</h4>

<p>The default configuration of RED is to assign the program 2/3 of the physical memory installed on your machine . Thus on a machine with 6GB of RAM, 4GB will
    be allocated to RED. Because of overheads in Java itself the amount of available memory reported in the welcome screen will be around 80% of the originally
    allocated memory. </p>

<p> This default allocation is then limited in some cases. If you are running a 32 bit operating system, or a 64 bit operating system but a 32 bit version of
    java then the maximum memory allocation is limited to 1.5GB, however much RAM is installed . If you want to make use of more memory than this you will need
    a 64 bit OS and version of java. On 64 bit machines running 64 bit java the top memory limit for RED is 8GB, and it's unlikely that you'll benefit from
    using more than that. </p>

<p>You can manually set the RED memory allocation by yourself. </p>
