<h3 id="section7.1">7.1 RED Preferences</h3>

<p>Under <em>Edit &gt; Preferences</em>, you could change preferences that can either improve the running of RED or to make it more suited to the way you work.
    In most cases, RED will work fine with the default values. If you are unsure about changing a preference then leave it alone. </p>

<p>All of your preferences are stored in a file of 'red_prefs.txt', which is present in the program directory. If you want to completely reset your preferences,
    you can simply delete this file and a default file will be created when RED is re-run. </p>

<p>There are four groups of preference settings which can be accessed via the tabs at the top of the window.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Files</strong> - allows you to set the default location where RED will look for different types of files</li>
    <li><strong>Memory</strong> - allows you to change the behaviour of RED to optimise memory usage</li>
    <li><strong>Network</strong> - allows you to enter settings which may be required to access the internet from your machine</li>
    <li><strong>Updates</strong> - allows you to say whether you want RED to check if it is the latest version available</li>
</ul>
