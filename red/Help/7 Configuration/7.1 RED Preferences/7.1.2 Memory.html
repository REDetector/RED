<h4>7.1.2 Memory</h4>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Disk caches</strong></li>
</ul>

<p> Large datasets come with huge amounts of mapped position data, which can consume large amounts of memory whilst being idle for most of the time. You can
    choose to save this data to cache files on disk to free up active memory. The cost for this is that every time you want to refer back to the data there will
    be a delay whilst the data is retrieved from disk. This will happen when you switch the genome view between chromosomes, or when you perform an operation
    such as filtering which needs to read through all of the data.</p>

<p>You need to tell RED which directory you want to use to save this data. Changes to the caching options will not have any effect until RED is restarted.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>File Compression</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>By default RED saves its data in a text based format which is quick to read, but is not designed to be a very compact format. If you choose to turn on file
    compression then all of your RED output files will be gzip compressed as they are written. This will reduce the filesize of your output by a factor of about
    3, but will increase the time to save data by a factor of about 2. Loading of compressed files is only marginally slower than uncompressed files. </p>
