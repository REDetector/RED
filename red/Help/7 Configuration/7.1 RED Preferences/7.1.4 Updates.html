<h4>7.1.4 Updates</h4>

<p>RED is under continual development and regular new releases will add new features and fix bugs which have been reported. It is a good idea to keep RED
    updated to the latest version to ensure you are benefitting from these development efforts. </p>

<p>By default every time RED is started it will check back with its download server to see if a newer version of the program is available. If a newer version
    has been released you will be informed of this - no change will be made to your existing program. To install the newer version you simply go back to the
    project website at <a href="https://github.com/REDetector/RED">https://github.com/REDetector/RED</a> and download the update.</p>

<p> If you do not want RED to check for updates then simply untick the &quot;Check for program updates on startup&quot; box in the updates preferences. </p>
