<h4>7.1.1 Files</h4>

<p>You can set locations for eight files. To change these, just press the browse button on the right of each field and select the directory you want. We
    strongly recommend you to stay default setting. These folders need to be writable by users of the program. </p>

<p>The file locations you can specify are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Project Data Directory</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The project data directory is the root directory to place your raw data. The following directories are under the project directory. The program firstly will
    search all data from this directory, and try to find out what you have cached before.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong> Genome Directory</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is the directory under which your genome files will be stored. These are automatically downloaded from the IGV server if your local drive doesn't exist
    the genome you want.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fasta Directory</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The fasta directory stores raw reference genome sequence relative to the genome. It can also contain a large amount of data. You may wish to change this to a
    local drive, or have the same genome folder shared by several users to save on disk space.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>RNA Directory</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The RNA directory stores RNA sequence which its format mainly contains bam/sam. The RNA data is essential to find out potential RNA editing sites. It can be
    used in <em>Denovo</em> or <em>non-Denovo</em> sequencing procedures. It can also contain a large amount of data. You may wish to change this to a local
    drive, or have the same genome folder shared by several users to save on disk space.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>DNA Directory</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The DNA directory stores DNA sequence which its format mainly contains bam/sam. The DNA data is essential if we perform non-Denovo sequencing procedure. It
    can also contain a large amount of data. You may wish to change this to a local drive, or have the same genome folder shared by several users to save on
    disk space.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Annotation Directory</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It may store a variety of annotation files which can be imported into custom annotation tracks. The track will be displayed in the future version.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Others Directory</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This directory saves some fragmentary files like 'cytoband.txt' from genome file.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Temp Directory</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The temp directory stores temporary cache file for data sets. The directory will be cleared when the program is closed.</p>
