<h4>7.1.3 Network</h4>

<p>If you was not able to access the internet directly, you may set up a proxy server by yourself. Since RED requires access to the network to be able to
    download genome annotation files, it needs to know if your network requires a proxy. If your network uses a proxy, you need to fill in the HTTP proxy server
    and HTTP proxy port boxes. The name of the server should be provided without an 'http://' prefix. If you don't use a proxy then the server box should be
    empty (it doesn't matter what is in the port box in this case). </p>

<p>The final option is to specify a location for the RED data server. Although it is possible for sites to run their own data servers this is not likely to be
    common and you should leave this alone unless you are absolutely sure that you need to change it. </p>
